Triage and analysis workflows provide intelligent automation for managing issues, investigating problems, and ensuring quality standards.

## When to Use Triage & Analysis Workflows

- **Auto-triage issues** - Classify and prioritize incoming issues
- **Accessibility audits** - Automated a11y checks on PRs
- **CI failure analysis** - Investigate and explain test failures
- **Problem investigation** - Deep dive into reported issues

Here are sample workflows from the Agentics collection you can customize for your project:
