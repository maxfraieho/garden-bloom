Quality and testing workflows automate test coverage analysis, performance optimization, and systematic quality improvements.

## When to Use Quality & Testing Workflows

- **Test coverage** - Daily incremental test improvements
- **Performance checks** - Automated performance regression detection
- **Quality gates** - Enforce standards on PRs
- **Systematic improvements** - Gradual quality enhancements

### Daily Test Coverage Improver

Analyzes test coverage, identifies gaps, and creates PRs with comprehensive tests to systematically improve code quality and reduce bugs. [Learn more](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics/blob/main/docs/daily-test-improver.md)

### Daily Performance Improver

Identifies performance bottlenecks, runs benchmarks, and implements optimizations to proactively improve application performance. [Learn more](https://github.com/githubnext/agentics/blob/main/docs/daily-perf-improver.md)

### Test Failure Investigation

Automatically investigates failed workflow runs by analyzing logs, identifying root causes, and creating detailed investigation reports with actionable recommendations to prevent similar failures. [Learn more](https://github.com/github/gh-aw/blob/main/.github/workflows/smoke-detector.md)
