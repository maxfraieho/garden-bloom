# delete-old-copilot-branches.sh - Find and delete old copilot/* branches
#
# This script identifies copilot/* branches that:
# - Have a closed or merged PR, OR have no PR at all
# - Last commit is at least 7 days old
#
# The script outputs git commands to delete these branches.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/delete-old-copilot-branches.sh
#
# Requirements:
#   - GitHub CLI (gh) installed and authenticated
#   - git installed
#   - Run from the repository root directory
#
# Environment Variables:
#   GITHUB_TOKEN - Optional. GitHub token for authentication (useful in CI/CD)
#   MAX_BRANCHES - Optional. Maximum number of branches to delete (default: unlimited)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - Success
#   1 - Error (missing dependencies, git errors, etc.)
