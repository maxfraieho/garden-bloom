What if you could use automated agentic workflows to maintain and improve your repository? 🎉

We're launching a blog series that shows how to use GitHub Agentic Workflows to keep real codebases healthy. You'll see 50+ agentic workflows running in production — from triaging issues to refactoring code to catching security vulnerabilities before they ship.

This isn't about demos or toy examples. You'll learn practical patterns you can adapt for your own repos, see the actual workflow code, and understand when agents work (and when they don't).

What if your repository could maintain itself? 🎉

We're launching a blog series from GitHub Next that takes you inside our real-world use of GitHub Agentic Workflows for software development. You'll discover how 50+ agentic workflows keep our repositories healthy — handling tasks from issue triage to continuous refactoring.

This series isn't about theoretical possibilities. You'll learn:
• Practical patterns for deploying automated AI agents in your repos
• When agentic workflows excel (and when they don't)
• How to design safe, effective agents your team can trust
• Real workflows you can study and adapt

Whether you're exploring repository automation for the first time or looking to level up your existing practices, you'll find actionable insights you can apply immediately.
