Ever notice how code gets messier over time, even in well-maintained projects? 🧹

Learn about two agents that continuously combat code complexity. The Code Simplifier watches your recent changes and suggests ways to make them clearer. The Duplicate Detector uses semantic analysis to spot hidden duplication that textual search misses.

You'll learn how these workflows prevent technical debt from accumulating instead of fighting it after the fact. We're sharing both workflows so you can see how continuous simplification works in practice.

What if your codebase could stay simple instead of gradually becoming more complex? 🧹

These two GitHub Agentic Workflows run continuously: one simplifies recently changed code, the other uses semantic analysis to spot hidden duplication. You'll see how they prevent technical debt before it accumulates.

How do you prevent technical debt instead of just managing it? 🧹

In this post, you'll discover two workflows built with GitHub Agentic Workflows that continuously simplify code:

**Automatic Code Simplifier**
This agent watches your recent changes and suggests improvements for clarity and maintainability. Instead of waiting for quarterly refactoring sprints, it keeps code simple as you write it.

**Duplicate Code Detector**
Using semantic analysis (powered by Serena embeddings), this workflow spots conceptual duplication that traditional textual search misses. It finds functions that do the same thing even when they look different.

You'll learn why continuous simplification is more effective than periodic cleanup, see the techniques that make these agents reliable, and get the complete workflow source code.
