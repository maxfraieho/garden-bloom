Does your code work but live in the wrong place? 🏗️

Learn about two GitHub Agentic Workflows that automate the refactoring of your code. The Semantic Function Refactor uses whole-repo analysis to find functions that belong elsewhere. The Go Pattern Detector combines fast AST scanning with targeted agent review for efficiency.

You'll learn an important pattern: use cheap tools (like ast-grep) to find candidates, then escalate only the interesting cases to AI analysis. This makes continuous refactoring affordable at scale.

How do you automate cleanup of AI code as your project grows? 🏗️

These GitHub Agentic Workflows look beyond "does it work?" to ask "is it in the right place?" One uses semantic analysis to spot organizational issues. The other shows you how to combine cheap AST scanning with targeted agent review.

Wondering how to maintain good code organization at scale for AI-generated code? 🏗️

Discover two structural refactoring workflows built with GitHub Agentic Workflows: one uses semantic analysis to find misplaced code, the other combines AST pattern detection with agent review for cost-effective continuous improvement.

How do you maintain good code organization for AI-generated code as your project scales? 🏗️

In this post, you'll discover two workflows built with GitHub Agentic Workflows that tackle structural problems:

**Semantic Function Refactor**
This agent analyzes your entire repository using semantic embeddings to identify functions that conceptually belong in different modules. It spots organizational issues that even experienced developers miss because it sees patterns across the whole codebase.

**Go Pattern Detector**
This workflow demonstrates a critical cost-optimization pattern: it uses ast-grep for fast, cheap AST scanning to find potential issues, then escalates only the interesting cases to an AI agent for deep review. You'll learn how this hybrid approach makes continuous analysis affordable.

These workflows show you how to maintain good architecture continuously rather than through painful quarterly refactoring efforts.
