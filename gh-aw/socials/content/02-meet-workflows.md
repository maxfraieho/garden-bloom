Tired of manually triaging every issue that lands in your repo? ✍️

Using GitHub Agentic Workflows, our Issue Triage agent does the first pass for you: it reads the issue, analyzes context from your codebase, replies with relevant information, and applies consistent labels automatically.

You'll learn how this workflow saves hours of maintainer time and why it's one of the highest-leverage agents we run. We're sharing the actual workflow source so you can see exactly how it works and adapt it for your repos.

How much time does your team spend manually triaging issues? ✍️

In this post, you'll discover our Issue Triage workflow — built with GitHub Agentic Workflows and one of the most immediately useful agents we run. When a new issue lands, this agent:

• Analyzes the report and searches relevant codebase context
• Replies with helpful information and related issues
• Applies consistent labels automatically
• Suggests next steps for maintainers

The result? Your team spends less time on repetitive triage and more time on actual development. This is one of those workflows that pays for itself in the first week.

You'll see exactly how it works, learn the patterns that make it reliable, and get access to the complete workflow source code.
